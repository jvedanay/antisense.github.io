<p> The heterochromatic regions of many plant and animal genomes pose a great challenge for geneticists to understand its structure and function. This challenge is partly because of its higly repetitive sequence composition, and therefore, poor sequence characterization. Due to these challenges, the heterochromatin has rightfully gained its name as the dark matter of biology in recent years. To tackle some of these challenges, in collaboration with J.J Emerson at University of California, Irvine,  Colin Meiklejon and Kristi Montooh at the University of Nebraska, Lincoln; and Amanda Larracuente at the University of Rochester, we are using single-molecule sequencing to uncover the complextity of heterochromatic regions from closely related <i> Drosophila </i> species from the <i>D. simulans</i> clade.</p>
