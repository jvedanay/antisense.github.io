<p> In collaboration with <a ref="http://www.faculty.uci.edu/profile.cfm?faculty_id=5987" title="J.J. Emerson">J.J. Emerson</a> at University of California, Irvine,  Colin Meiklejon and Kristi Montooh at the University of Nebraska, Lincoln; and Amanda Larracuente at the University of Rochester, we are using single-molecule sequencing to uncover the complextity of heterochromatic regions from closely related <i> Drosophila </i> species from the <i>D. simulans</i> clade.</p>
