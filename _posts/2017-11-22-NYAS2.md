title: On Physics, Philosophy, and the limits to human understanding
category: blog
---

<p> Talking about academic disciplines in which I have shallow knowledge is akin to walking a tightrope without a balancing pole. I am yet inclined to write on this arguably two of the oldest and arduous fields of academic pursuit, physics and philosophy, with some recent knowledge gained from the &quot;Physics of Everything&quot; discussion series at the New York Academy of Sciences. While I have no formal academic training in either physics or philosopy, both fields of study have always intrigued me. The former deals with interpreting the laws of nature, and the latter with the mind that construes these natural phenomena. There is deeper meaning to nature itself, once you begin to delve into the depths of hidden, abstract reality illuminated at intersection of physics and philosophy. However, more recent findings in physics have widened the gaps in knowledge, arguing whether everything around us can be explained by physical abstractions. Recognized as "God of the gaps" from a theological perspective, modern science certainly is challenged with the question <i> are there limits to human understanding ? </i> </p>

<p> This exacty was the question an eminent panel of physicits and philosphers, attempted to tacke at the Physics of everything discussion series. Two of the prominent discussants worth mentioning are Jim Holt </p>
