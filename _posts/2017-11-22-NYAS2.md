title: On Physics, Philosophy, and the limits to human understanding
category: blog
---

<p> Talking about disciplines in which I have a shallow knowledge is akin to walking a tightrope without a balancing pole. Now, imagine me doing this stunt few hundred meters above the ground. This imaginary tightrope walk will precisely sum my attempt to integrate ideas in physics and philosophy to argue if there are limits to human understanding. I am very much aware of the outcome of my imaginary stunt, but I am yet inclined to write on this topic with recent knowledge gained from the &quot;Physics of Everything&quot; discussion series at the New York Academy of Sciences. This new understanding of modern physics will be my balance pole for this tightrope walk. While I have no formal academic training in either physics or philosopy, both disciplines have always intrigued me: the former deals with interpreting the laws of nature, and the latter with the mind that interprets these natural phenomena. There is deeper meaning to nature itself, once you begin to delve into the depths of these disciplines of study. However, more recent findings in physics have widened the gaps in knowledge, arguing whether everthing around us can be explained by physical abstractions? Recognized as "God of the gaps" from a theological perspective, modern science certainly is challenged with the question <i> are there limits to human understanding ? </i> </p>
