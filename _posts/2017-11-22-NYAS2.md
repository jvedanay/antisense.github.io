title: On Physics, Philosophy, and the limits to human understanding
category: blog

<p> Conversing in academic disciplines in which I have shallow knowledge is akin to walk a tightrope without the balancing pole. The outcome of this imaginary stunt will predictably be a debacle. I am yet inclined to write on two of the arduous and oldest fields of academic pursuit&mdash;Physics and Philosophy&mdash;with some recent knowledge gained from the &quot;Physics of Everything&quot; discussion series at the New York Academy of Sciences. As a cautionary note, I have no formal academic training in either Physics or Philosopy, but both fields of study have always intrigued me enough to be an autodidact, just to overcome boredom during periods of information overload in Biology. Physics, with a strong mathematical bedrock deals with interpreting the laws of nature, while philosophy deals with the mind, and methods that construes these natural phenomena. There is deeper meaning to nature itself, once you begin to delve into the depths of hidden, abstract reality illuminated at the intersection of Physics and Philosophy. However, more recent findings in Physics have widened the gaps in knowledge, arguing whether everything around us can be explained by physical abstractions. Recognized as "God of the gaps" from a theological perspective, modern science certainly is challenged with the question <i> are there limits to human understanding ? </i> </p>

<p> This exacty was the question an eminent panel of physicists and philosphers, attempted to tacke at the Physics of everything discussion series. Two of the prominent discussants worth mentioning are <a href="https://sitp.stanford.edu/people/eva-silverstein"title=Eva Silverstein">Eva Silverstein</a> from the Stanford University, who investigates basic questions in several areas of theoretical physics, most notably on recently-detected gravitational waves, and <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/contributors/jim-holt" title="Jim Holt">Jim Holt</a>&mdash; an American philosopher, author and essayist, who is best known for his book &quot;Why does the world exist?&quot, which eloquently argued <i> Why is there even something rather than nothing?</i>. Among six panelits in two separate discussion events, experts from both Physics and Philosophy took the stage to address a question, the answer for which is certainly beyond the bounds of possibility. As a disclaimer, every panelist at the podium unanimously agreed that the question under discussion is rather diffult to answer. However, they weighed in on some of the outstanding epistemic advances the field of Physics made from the times of ancient Greece to the development of humungous detectors that identified sub-atomic particles to gravitational waves. We can only make baby-steps in science and this true for most fields of scientific inquiry. Much of the progress in Physics came during the later half of second millennium, not becuase we lacked extraordinary scientific minds before that, but just becuasue the right tools were not available or the right methods were not developed. For instance, had calculus arrived few centuries before Newton, the course of developments may have altogether taken a very different trajectory. </p>
