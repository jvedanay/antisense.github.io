title: Cultivating character at the New York Academy of Sciences

<p> It is fun to watch two academics argue and differ in opinion on a subject. When more than two scholars, with varied academic expertise in philosophy of science, psychology, and humaen philosophy take the stage for a discussion, the fun most certainly turns into festivity of arguments. I was recently at the New York Academy of Sciences to participate in what can be called a slightly unusual event hosted by the Academy: a discussion on character and wisdom. The discussants were eminent philosophers, <a href="http://philosophy.columbia.edu/directories/faculty/philip-kitcher" title="Philip Kitcher">Philip Kitcher</a> of Columbia University, who is best known for his book &quot;The Ethical Project&quot;, <a href="http://philosophy.umn.edu/people/FacultyProfile.php?UID=tiberius/" title="Valerie Tiberius">Valerie Tiberius</a> from the University of Minnesota, and psychologist/neuroscientist <a href="http://www.northeastern.edu/cos/faculty/lisa-feldman-barrett/" title="Lisa Feldman Barrett">Lisa Feldman Barrett</a> from the Northeastern University. <br></p>

<p>The overall theme of the discussion was straitforward: <i>What is wisdom and how can one obtain it?</i>. To be frank, I never really had any hope that this question may be answered in an hour-and-a-half discussion. Promptly, the discussants acknowledged this fact at the beginning: even the wisest men [and women] may not be wise at all circumstances, alluding to the fact that wisdom itself is subjective. While this was introduced as a cautionary note, the discussants emphasized how and why this question has remanied a central topic of discussion in philosophy for centuries [rather millenia]. As Dr. Kitcher pointed out, the meaning of wisdom itself has changed over centuries, adapting to changes in human culture over time.</p> 

<p>For example, in Athenian philosophy &quot;getting along&quot; with fellow humans is considered good wisdom. While this tenet is still true, wisdom for success in today's world is prescribed by &quot;getting ahead&quot; of fellow humans, noted Dr. Barrett during the discussion. The question then is <i>Has the definition of wisdom changed in the history of philosophy over time? </i> While all the discussants unanimously agreed that wisdom in the eyes of Aristole was different from the thinking of modern era philosophers like Emerson, they also seemed to agree that certain tenets of wisdom remain unchanged: that is, wisdom is an invaluable virtue that may not be easily obtained, and has a deep connection to the ethical goodness. If so, where in the human mind is morality coded? and can we precisely identify the part of the human brain that is responsible for ethical goodness? These are not simple questions to answer, but the discussion took a turn to the path of fiery arguments from here. </p>

<p>Lisa Feldman Barrett is a psycologist/neuroscientist, who laid out her ambitious research plan to map the &quot;consiousness&quot;part of the human brain. By understanding the deeper complexity of the human brain, she claimed that in the near future, scientists should be able to have a glimplse of the part of the brain that makes moral decisions. Philip Kitcher, who is a phlosopher of science, almost instantaneously disagreed to this ambitious plan. As a biologist, my opinion very well reflected his stand point on this issue. Let's take for example, the nematode <i> Caenorhabditis elegans </i>, a small worm studied by scientists to understand various biological phenomena like behaviour, locomotion, mating <i> et cetra </i>. This simple worm is composed of less than a thousand cells, and yet, its neural circuitry is as complex as any larger animal. Dr. Kitcher was very skeptical on how the proposed plan to study several million neural connections in the human brain be feasbile, while scientists do not have a clear picture of the function of neural cells in worms. </p>

<p> We can only make baby steps in science, said Dr. Kitcher, drawing examples from the field of genetics. With the dawn of genetics as a branch of biology in the early 20<sup>th</sup> century, it took almost a hundred years for scientists to map and sequence the human genome. Early geneticists did not propose to use genetics right away to cure human diseases, but rather started studying eye color in the fruit fly, which led to a remarkable revolution in genetics that led us slowly to understanding human diseases. So the point is, good science demands two things: you ask the right and manageable questions and get the simple and correct answers. The chance of getting right answers will increase only when the questions are simple. However, Dr. Tiberius interjected the conversation to say that modern science is prepared to deal with complex questions, and that the scientific world in the 21<sup>st</sup> century is ready to tackle &quot;big&quot; questions. While I thoroughlly enjoyed these arguments, I was not sure if the audience who were there to hear about wisdom and character were happy to learn philosophy of science. </p>
