title: Cultivating character at the New York Academy of Sciences

<p> It is fun to watch two academics argue and differ in opinion on a subject. When more than two scholars, with varied academic expertise in philosophy of science, psychology, and humaen philosophy take the stage for a discussion, the fun most certainly turns into festivity of arguments. I was recently at the New York Academy of Sciences to participate in a slightly unsual event hosted by the Academy: a discussion on character and wisdom. The discussants were eminent philosophers, <a href="http://philosophy.columbia.edu/directories/faculty/philip-kitcher" title="Philip Kitcher">Philip Kitcher</a> from the Columbia University, <a href="http://philosophy.umn.edu/people/FacultyProfile.php?UID=tiberius/" title="Valerie Tiberius">Valerie Tiberius</a> from the University of Minnesota, and psychologist/neuroscientist <a href="http://www.northeastern.edu/cos/faculty/lisa-feldman-barrett/" title="Lisa Feldman Barrett">Lisa Feldman Barrett</a> from the Northeastern University. <br></p>

<p>The overall theme of the discussion was quite straitforward: <i>What is wisdom and how can one obtain it?</i>. Walking into the Academy, I never really had any hope that this question may be answered in an hour-and-a-half discussion. Promptly, the discussants acknowledged this fact at the very beginning: even the wisest men [and women] do not really know the true meaning of wisdom. The reason is, this has remained a central question in philosophy for centuries.</p>
