title: Cultivating character at the New York Academy of Sciences

<p> It is fun to watch two academics argue and differ in opinion on a subject. When more than two scholars, with varied academic expertise in philosophy of science, psychology, and humaen philosophy take the stage for a discussion, the fun most certainly turns into festivity of arguments. I was recently at the New York Academy of Sciences to participate in what can be called a slightly unusual event hosted by the Academy: a discussion on character and wisdom. The discussants were eminent philosophers, <a href="http://philosophy.columbia.edu/directories/faculty/philip-kitcher" title="Philip Kitcher">Philip Kitcher</a> of Columbia University, who is best known for his book &quot;The Ethical Project&quot;, <a href="http://philosophy.umn.edu/people/FacultyProfile.php?UID=tiberius/" title="Valerie Tiberius">Valerie Tiberius</a> from the University of Minnesota, and psychologist/neuroscientist <a href="http://www.northeastern.edu/cos/faculty/lisa-feldman-barrett/" title="Lisa Feldman Barrett">Lisa Feldman Barrett</a> from the Northeastern University. <br></p>

<p>The overall theme of the discussion was straitforward: <i>What is wisdom and how can one obtain it?</i>. To be frank, I never really had any hope that this question may be answered in an hour-and-a-half discussion. Promptly, the discussants acknowledged this fact at the beginning: even the wisest men [and women] may not be wise at all circumstances, alluding to the fact that wisdom itself is subjective. While this was introduced as a cautionary note, the discussants emphasized how and why this question has remanied a central topic of discussion in philosophy for centuries [rather millenia]. As Dr. Kitcher pointed out, the meaning of wisdom itself has changed over centuries, adapting to changes in human culture over time.</p> 

<p>For example, in Athenian philosophy &quot;getting along&quot; with fellow humans is considered good wisdom. While this tenet is still true, wisdom for success in today's world is prescribed by &quot;getting ahead&quot; of fellow humans, noted Dr. Barrett during the discussion. The question then is <i>Has the definition of wisdom changed in the history of philosophy over time? </i> While all the discussants unanimously agreed that wisdom in the eyes of Aristole was different from the thinking of modern era philosophers like Emerson, they also seemed to agree that certain tenets of wisdom remain unchanged: that is, wisdom is an invaluable virtue that may not be easily obtained, and has a deep connection to the ethical goodness. If so, where in the human mind is morality coded? and can we precisely identify the part of the human brain that is responsible for ethical goodness? These are not simple questions to answer, but discussion took a notorious turn to the path of fiery arguments. </p>

<p>Lisa Feldman Barrett is a psycologist/neuroscientist, who laid out her ambitious research plan to map the &quot;consiousness&quot;part of the human brain. By understanding the deeper complexity of the human brain, she claimed that in the near future, scientists should be able to have a glimplse of the part of the brain that makes moral decisions. Philip Kitcher, who specializes is the philosophy of science, almost instantaneously disagreed to this ambitious plan. As a biologist, my opinion was the same too. Let's take for example, the nematode <i> Caenorhabditis elegans </i>, a model organism studied by several scientists across the globe. This simple worm is made of less than a thousand cells, and yet, its neural circuitry is not completely understood. If so, would it be feasible to study and understand several million neural connections in the human brain? </p>
