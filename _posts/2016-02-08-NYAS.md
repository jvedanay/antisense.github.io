<p> It is fun to watch two academics argue and differ in opinion on a subject. When more than two scholars, with varied academic expertise in philosophy of science, psychology, and humaen philosophy take the stage for a discussion, the fun most certainly turns into festivity of arguments. I was recently at the New York Academy of Sciences to participate in what can be called a slightly unusual event hosted by the Academy: a discussion on character and wisdom. The discussants were eminent philosophers, <a href="http://philosophy.columbia.edu/directories/faculty/philip-kitcher" title="Philip Kitcher">Philip Kitcher</a> of Columbia University, who is best known for his book &quot;The Ethical Project&quot;, <a href="http://philosophy.umn.edu/people/FacultyProfile.php?UID=tiberius/" title="Valerie Tiberius">Valerie Tiberius</a> from the University of Minnesota, and psychologist/neuroscientist <a href="http://www.northeastern.edu/cos/faculty/lisa-feldman-barrett/" title="Lisa Feldman Barrett">Lisa Feldman Barrett</a> from the Northeastern University. <br></p>

<p>The overall theme of the discussion was quite straitforward: <i>What is wisdom and how can one obtain it?</i>. To be frank, walking into the Academy, I never really had any hope that this question may be answered in an hour-and-a-half discussion. Promptly, the discussants acknowledged this fact at the very beginning: even the wisest men [and women] may not be wise in all circumstances, alluding to the fact that wisdom itself is subjective. While this was introduced as a cautionary note, the discussants emphasized how and why this question has remanied a central topic of discussion in philosophy for centuries [rather millenia]. As Dr. Kitcher pointed out, the meaning of wisdom itself has changed over centuries, adapting to changes in human culture over time.</p> 

<p>For example, in Athenian philosophy &quot;getting along&quot; with fellow humans is considered good wisdom. While this still is true, wisdom for success in today's world is prescribed by &quot;getting ahead&quot; of fellow humans. </p>
