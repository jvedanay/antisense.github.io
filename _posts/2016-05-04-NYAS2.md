title: On Physics, Philosophy, and the limits to human understanding
category: blog
---

<p> Talking about disciplines in which I have a shallow knowledge is akin to walking a tightrope without a balance pole. Now, imagine me doing this stunt at a few thousand meters above the ground. This imaginary stunt will precisely sum my attempt to integrate ideas in physics and philosophy to argue if there are limits to human understanding. I am very much aware of the outcome of this tightrope stunt, but I am yet inclined to write on this topic from recent knowledge gained from discussions on the &quot;Physics of Everything&quot; series at the New York Academy of Sciences. I will use some of the knowledge gained from these panel discussions as my balance pole for this tightrope walk. While I have no formal academic training in either physics or philosopy, I have a penchant for both these disciplines of study. One deals with interpreting the laws of nature, and the other deals with the mind that interprets these natural phenomena. But the ultimate question is, whether everthing around us can be explained by either physical or philosophical abstractions, or simply put, <i> are there limits to human understanding ? </i> </p>
