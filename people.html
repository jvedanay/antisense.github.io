<p align="left"> <font size="3"> I joined UTSA’s Developmental and Regenerative Sciences program <img src="/img/Jeffrey_Vedanayagam.jpg" align="right" style="width: 150px; height: 200px; border: 0;">  
within the Department of Neuroscience, Developmental and Regenerative Biology as an Assistant Professor in Fall 2023. 
Prior to that, I was an NIH Pathway to Independence postdoctoral fellow in the Developmental Biology Program at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York and 
obtained my Ph.D. in Evolutionary/Population genomics from the University of Rochester, NY. I began 
to use <i> Drosophila </i> as a model to study germline conflicts both during my graduate and postdoctoral work. At UTSA, our work on 
selfish genes and genetic conflicts continues with the <i> Drosophila </i> model. In addition, we use bioinformatics 
approaches to examine genome sequence data from vertebrate model organisms such as mice to understand how selfish genes shape genome evolution. </font></p>

<p align="left"> <font size="3"> My name is Milagros Alonso, Mili for short, and I was <img src="/img/Mili_Alonso.jpg" height="200px" width="150px" style="float:right; border: 0; padding-left: 10px"> 
  born in Mar del Plata, Argentina. I obtained my Bachelors degree at UTSA in Environmental Science with a concentration in Wildlife Management and Conservation. 
  Since my graduation from UTSA, I’ve had the pleasure of working with and learning from some of the most intelligent and passionate Keepers in the zoological field 
  at the San Antonio Zoo, and a non-profit animal education facility called Zoomagination. Now, by joining UTSA’s own Neuroscience, Developmental and Regenerative 
  Biology Department as a Research Assistant Scientist, I’m excited to return to my roots to push my learning and 
  understanding of the Sciences that govern our lives every day. </font></p>

  support to the EDGe lab. I was rescued in Brooklyn, NY, and made my way to Texas when the lab was founded in Fall 2023. I have  
  mastered the art of sighing and each sigh is loaded with emotion. Especially, when 
  you show your rejected papers, grants, summary statements, etc. You can call me the Shakespeare of sighs. 
  Make sure you don't drop anything on the floor, I am on it faster than any high-tech vacuum. Also remember, I'm eco-friendly 
  and powered entirely by treats and belly rubs. I am here to cheer you all up! </font></p>
