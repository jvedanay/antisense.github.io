<p align="left"> <font size="3"> My name is Milagros Alonso, Mili for short, and I was <img src="/img/Mili_Alonso.jpg" align="right" style="width: 150px; height: 200px; border: 0;"> 
  born in Mar del Plata, Argentina. I obtained my Bachelors degree at UTSA in Environmental Science with a concentration in Wildlife Management and Conservation. Since my graduation 
  from UTSA, I’ve had the pleasure of working with and learning from some of the most intelligent and passionate Keepers in the zoological 
  field at the San Antonio Zoo, and a non-profit animal education facility called Zoomagination. Now, by joining UTSA’s own Neuroscience, Developmental and Regenerative 
  Biology Department as a Research Assistant Scientist, I’m excited to return to my roots to push my learning and understanding of the 
  Sciences that govern our lives every day. </font></p>

support to the EDGe lab. I was rescued in Brooklyn, NY, and made my way to Texas when the lab was founded in Fall 2023. I have 
mastered the art of sighing and each sigh is loaded with emotion. Especially, when you show your rejected papers, grants, summary
statements, etc. You can call me the Shakespeare of sighs. Make sure you don't drop anything on the floor, I am on it faster than any high-tech vacuum. 
Also remember, I'm eco-friendly and powered entirely by treats and belly rubs. I am here to cheer you all up! </font></p>
