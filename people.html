<p align="left"> <font size="3"> My name is Milagros Alonso, Mili for short, and I was born in Mar del Plata, Argentina. My parents moved my three older siblings and I to Spring, TX, when 
I was four years old and I grew up there, developing a love for reading and writing, playing videogames with my brothers, and learning about film production and fashion. I also fell in 
love with Science, any and all parts of it, which is why after spending some time at my <img src="/img/Mili_Alonso.jpg" align="right" style="width: 150px; height: 200px; border: 0;"> local community college, I moved to San Antonio, TX and enrolled at UTSA to pursue a Bachelors 
degree in Environmental Science with a concentration in Wildlife Management and Conservation.

<br> Since graduating UTSA I’ve had the pleasure of working with and learning from some of the most intelligent and passionate Keepers in the zoological field at the SA Zoo, SA SeaWorld, and 
a non-profit animal education facility called Zoomagination. I was fortunate to get to work with, train, and care for birds, mammals, and reptiles of all sizes, and got to meet 
large marine mammals up close and participate in their training as well. Working with animals was always a lot of fun, but after a while I realized that I was missing a core 
part of what made me fall in love with Science and Animal Biology to begin with, and that was an aspect of research and experimentation and new discovery. Now, by joining UTSA’s own 
Neuroscience, Developmental and Regenerative Biology Department as a Research Assistant Scientist, I’m excited to return to my roots and start a fresh new chapter in my professional 
career as I continue to push my learning and understanding of the Sciences that govern our lives every day. </p>
