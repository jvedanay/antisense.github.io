<p align="justify"> <font size="3"> I joined UTSA’s Developmental and Regenerative Sciences program <img src="/img/Jeffrey_Vedanayagam.jpg" height="200px" width="160px" style="float:right; border: 0; padding-left: 10px;">
	within the Department of Neuroscience, Developmental and Regenerative Biology as an Assistant Professor in Fall 2023. Prior to that, I was an NIH 
	Pathway to Independence postdoctoral fellow in the Developmental Biology Program at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York and 
	obtained my Ph.D. in Evolutionary/Population genomics from the University of Rochester, NY. I began to use <i> Drosophila </i> as a model to 
	study germline conflicts both during my graduate and postdoctoral work. At UTSA, our work on selfish genes and genetic conflicts continues with 
	the <i> Drosophila </i> model. In addition, we use bioinformatics approaches to examine genome sequence data from vertebrate model organisms such 
	as mice to understand how selfish genes shape genome evolution. </font></p>

	I graduated from Texas A&M University in 2019 with a Bachelor’s of Science in Biomedical Sciences. I received my Master of Science in Biology 
	in 2021 from University of Houston. After I graduated, I worked as a Research Assistant at  Baylor College of Medicine’s Human Genome Sequencing 
	Center, which further ignited my interests in molecular biology and genomics and inspired me to pursue a PhD. When I am not in lab doing experiments, 
	my hobbies include knitting and crocheting and caring for two aquariums--a 10 gallon with tropical fish and an albino catfish and a 29-gallon housing 
	a beautiful chunky goldfish. I also enjoy working out, reading, cooking, and listening to music. I absolutely love spending time with my family. I 
	have one older sister and one younger sister, and we love making our parents laugh. We are all very close and they have always supported my passion for science. </font></p>

<p align="justify"> <font size="3"> My name is Milagros Alonso, Mili for short, and I was <img src="/img/Mili_Alonso.jpg" height="200px" width="160px" style="float:right; border: 0; padding-left: 10px"> 
	born in Mar del Plata, Argentina. I obtained my Bachelors degree at UTSA in Environmental Science with a concentration in Wildlife Management and Conservation. 
  Since my graduation from UTSA, I’ve had the pleasure of working with and learning from some of the most intelligent and passionate Keepers in the zoological field 
  at the San Antonio Zoo, and a non-profit animal education facility called Zoomagination. Now, by joining UTSA’s own Neuroscience, Developmental and Regenerative 
  Biology Department as a Research Assistant Scientist, I’m excited to return to my roots to push my learning and 
  understanding of the Sciences that govern our lives every day. </font></p>

	As of this summer 2024, I have completed two semesters with UTSA. I am a psychology major and am going to pursue a biology minor with the intention of going pre-med. 
	I have lived in San Antonio for almost 12 years. I love to read and draw and I absolutely love watching nature documentaries. Fun fact about me, my family and I have 
	two backyard chickens named Coco and Alice!</font></p>

<p align="justify"> <font size="3"> I was born in Chicago, however I moved to San Antonio right after my first year. <img src="/img/talha_mazhar.jpg" height="200px" width="160px" style="float:right; border: 0; padding-left: 10px;">
	I have two sisters, one is younger and the other is older, and I have a total of 5 cats! I love all of them equally, and honestly would not be able to live 
	without them, they mean the world to me. Fortunately, I was able to attend elementary school, middle school, high school, and now pursue higher education 
	for something that I love, which is medicine. At my time at college, I was fortunate to be able to meet some amazing new people and form plenty of new 
	friendships, which allowed me to try out different things that I normally wouldn’t such as learning to play a piano or competitively play chess. Throughout 
	my time in college, I also want to be able to contribute my time to advance research in any possible way in order to continue to improve people’s health. 
	Some of my all-time favorite activities/hobbies include traveling, listening to new music, boxing, reading, hiking, and playing games. My ultimate goal is 
	to go to medical school to become an anesthesiologist, and give back to my parents and the community.</font></p>

	During my time here, I’ve realized my interest in research and I hope to pursue graduate school and a career in infectious disease after completing my Bachelors.
	In my free time, I love hiking, swimming, reading, or playing games with my friends and family. I’m so grateful for the opportunity to get hands on research experience in 	this lab</font></p>

  support to the EDGe lab. I was rescued in Brooklyn, NY, and made my way to Texas when the lab was founded in Fall 2023. I have  
  mastered the art of sighing and each sigh is loaded with emotion. Especially, when 
  you show your rejected papers, grants, summary statements, etc. You can call me the Shakespeare of sighs. 
  Make sure you don't drop anything on the floor, I am on it faster than any high-tech vacuum. Also remember, I'm eco-friendly 
  and powered entirely by treats and belly rubs. I am here to cheer you all up! </font></p>
