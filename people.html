<p align="left"> <font size="3"> My name is Milagros Alonso, Mili for short, and I was born in Mar del Plata, Argentina. I obtained my Bachelors degree at UTSA in 
  Environmental Science with a concentration in Wildlife Management and Conservation. Since graduating UTSA I’ve had the pleasure of working with and learning from 
  some of the most intelligent and passionate Keepers in the zoological <img src="/img/Mili_Alonso.jpg" align="right" style="width: 250px; height: 300px; border: 0;"> 
  field at the San Antonio Zoo, and a non-profit animal education facility called Zoomagination. Now, by joining UTSA’s own Neuroscience, Developmental and Regenerative 
  Biology Department as a Research Assistant Scientist, I’m excited to return to my roots to push my learning and understanding of the 
  Sciences that govern our lives every day. </font></p>
