<p align="left"> <font size="3"> I joined UTSA’s Developmental and Regenerative Sciences program within the Department of Neuroscience, Developmental <img src="/img/Jeffrey_Vedanayagam.jpg" align="right" style="width: 150px; height: 200px; border: 0;"> 
and Regenerative Biology as an Assistant Professor in Fall 2023. Prior to that, I was an NIH Pathway to Independence postdoctoral 
fellow in the Developmental Biology Program at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York and 
obtained my Ph.D. in Evolutionary/Population genomics from the University of Rochester, NY. I began 
to use Drosophila as a model to study germline genetic conflicts (between transposable elements and the piwi-interacting RNA pathway) 
as a graduate student—a theme which continued during my postdoctoral work, where I expanded my studies to another class of selfish genes 
called meiotic drive genes and how their selfish activities are suppressed by the endogenous RNAi pathway. At UTSA, our work on 
understanding germline genetic conflicts continues with the Drosophila model, and in addition, we use bioinformatics 
approaches to examine genome sequence data from vertebrate model organisms such as mice to understand 
how selfish genes shape genome evolution. </font></p>

<p align="left"> <font size="3"> My name is Milagros Alonso, Mili for short, and I was <img src="/img/Mili_Alonso.jpg" align="right" style="width: 150px; height: 200px; border: 0;"> 
  born in Mar del Plata, Argentina. I obtained my Bachelors degree at UTSA in Environmental Science with a concentration in Wildlife Management and Conservation. Since my graduation 
  from UTSA, I’ve had the pleasure of working with and learning from some of the most intelligent and passionate Keepers in the zoological 
  field at the San Antonio Zoo, and a non-profit animal education facility called Zoomagination. Now, by joining UTSA’s own Neuroscience, Developmental and Regenerative 
  Biology Department as a Research Assistant Scientist, I’m excited to return to my roots to push my learning and understanding of the 
  Sciences that govern our lives every day. </font></p>

<p align="left"> <font size="3"> I am Zeno and I like paradoxes. I provide administrative (and emotional) <img src="/img/Zeno.jpg" align="right" style="width: 150px; height: 200px; border: 0;">
support to the EDGe lab. I was rescued in Brooklyn, NY, and made my way to Texas when the lab was founded in Fall 2023. I have  
mastered the art of sighing and each sigh is loaded with emotion. Especially, when 
you show your rejected papers, grants, summary statements, etc. You can call me the Shakespeare of sighs. 
Make sure you don't drop anything on the floor, I am on it faster than any high-tech vacuum. Also remember, I'm eco-friendly 
and powered entirely by treats and belly rubs. I am here to cheer you all up! </font></p>
