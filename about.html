## About

I am a Research Fellow in the Department of Developmental Biology at the Sloan-Kettering Institute. I am an evolutionary geneticist by training 
and my area of research includes evolutionary and population genomics, genomic conflict between selfish genetic elements and their host silencing
machinery. I use fruit flies as a model organism to study a variety of interesting biological questions.
