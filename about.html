## About

I am a Research Fellow in the Department of Developmental Biology at the Sloan-Kettering Institute. I am an evolutionary geneticist by training 
and my area of research includes evolutionary and population genomics, genomic conflict between selfish genetic elements and their host silencing
machinery. I use fruit flies as a model organism to study a variety of interesting biological questions. <a href="https://www.quora.com/GitHub/What-is-the-story-behind-GitHub%E2%80%99s-octocat-mascot" target="_blank">[via]</a>.
