## About

<p>I am a Research Fellow in the Developmental Biology Program at the <a href="https://www.mskcc.org/research-areas/programs-centers/ski" title="Sloan Kettering Institute, New York.">Sloan Kettering Institute, New York.</a> 
I am an evolutionary biologist by training and received my Ph.D. in evolutionary genetics from the <a href="https://www.rochester.edu/" title="University of Rochester, New York">University of Rochester, New York.</a>
My research is broadly in the areas of evolutionary and population genomics; small RNA-mediated immunity against selfish genetic elements; and the evolution of small RNA pathways in animals.  
I use fruit flies <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drosophila "title="Drosophila">Drosophila</a> as a model organism to study a variety of interesting biological questions.</p>
