## About


<p align="left">
I am currently an NIH Pathway to Independence postdoctoral fellow in Dr. Eric Lai's lab in the Developmental Biology program and co-mentored by Dr. Scott Keeney (HHMI/Molecular Biology program) at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, NY.  
I received my Ph.D. in Biology (with a focus on Evolutionary genetics/genomics) from the University of Rochester, NY, where I studied the evolution of the piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA) pathway that regulates transposable elements (TEs) 
during germline development, using closely related Drosophila species as a model system. My Ph.D. work primarily focused on using computational and evolutionary approaches to understand <img src="/img/JV_picture.png" align="right" border="0" style="width: 300px; height: 360px;"> the evolutionary arms race between transposable elements 
and host suppression via the piRNA pathway (funded by an Ernst Caspari Fellowship from the University of Rochester and a Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant from the National Science Foundation). For my postdoctoral work,  I acquired 
cross-disciplinary training in molecular biology and expanded my studies to endogenous RNAi regulation of another class of selfish genetic elements called Meiotic drivers. In particular, I am studying the evolution of de novo genes with selfish properties 
that can "cheat" Mendelian segregation during spermatogenesis in the Drosophila male germline (funded by a K99/R00 Pathway to Independence Award from the National Institute of General Medical Sciences). </p>

<p align="left"> Broadly,  my research is centered around studying  1) the evolution and regulation of selfish genes (Meiotic drivers and transposable elements), 2) intragenomic conflicts during germline development and their consequences on 
reproduction and fertility, 3) Causes and consequences of the rapid evolution of proteins involved in germline processes (meiosis, transposon regulation, and chromatin remodeling factors), and 4) evolution of sex chromosomes and their contributions 
to meiotic drive, hybrid sterility, and impacts on the male reproductive system. </p> 

<p align="left"> In addition to my research on selfish genetic elements and their regulation by small RNA pathways, taking advantage of my training in computational and evolutionary genomics, I have contributed to several "omic" studies both during 
my graduate and postdoctoral work, including  large-scale population genomic analyses in Drosophila and the analysis of the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) and the Memorial Sloan-Kettering-IMPACT profiling of tumor samples to examine the effects of 
recurrent mutations in the miRNA processing enzyme DICER1 and their contributions to tumorigenesis.</p>
