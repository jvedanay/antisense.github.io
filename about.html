Welcome to the Evolutionary and Developmental Genomics (EDGe) lab at UTSA. Our group is nested within the Developmental and Regenerative Sciences program in the 
Department of Neuroscience, Developmental and Regenerative Biology. Broadly, our research focuses on understanding the evolution and function(s) of a class of ‘selfish’ 
genes called meiotic drive genes, which violate Mendel’s law of segregation during gamete formation (sperm and egg cells). We study how their selfish activities 
can adversely affect germline development, reproduction, and fertility. We use <i>Drosophila</i> as a model study meiotic drive, and our research utilizes a combination of 
evolutionary genomics, molecular biology, and bioinformatics approaches to study their molecular mechanisms of action. </p>

Besides, our laboratory is also interested in understanding how genetic conflicts mediated by selfish genes (such as meiotic drive genes and transposable elements) shape 
the evolution of genes essential for germline development and fertility. On a connected theme, using extensive integrative genomic resources available from model organisms 
such as <i>Drosophila</i>, mice, and primates, our research focuses on discovering novel genes (conserved and lineage-specific) essential for male fertility. </p>
