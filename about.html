## About

I am a Research Fellow in the Department of Developmental Biology at the Sloan Kettering Institute, New York. I am an evolutionary biologist by training 
with interests in evolutionary and population genomics; molecular evolution;  genomic conflict and selfish genetic elements; and the evolution of
small RNA pathways in animals. I use fruit flies as a model organism to study a variety of interesting biological questions.
