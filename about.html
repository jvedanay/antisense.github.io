## About

<p>I am a NIH Pathway to Independence fellow in the Developmental Biology Program at the <a href="https://www.mskcc.org/research-areas/programs-centers/ski" title="Sloan Kettering Institute, New York.">Sloan Kettering Institute, New York.</a> 
I am an evolutionary biologist by training and received my Ph.D. in evolutionary genetics from the <a href="https://www.rochester.edu/" title="University of Rochester, New York">University of Rochester, New York.</a> My current research focuses on understanding the roles of endogenous RNAi in controlling selfish meiotic drive systems (SMDs) using <i>Drosophila simulans</i> as a model. Furthermore, using a combination of genetics, molecular, and computational approaches, my work is now leading to a mechanistic understanding of how <i>de novo</i> SMDs compromise critical cellular mechanisms in the germline. In addition to addressing fundamental evolutionary questions, my work on the Big Data analytics front involves the analysis of the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) and the Memorial Sloan-Kettering-IMPACT profiling of tumor samples to examine the effects of recurrent mutations in the miRNA processing enzyme <i>DICER1</i> and their contributions to tumorigenesis.
